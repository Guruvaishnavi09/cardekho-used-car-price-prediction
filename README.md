# Used Car Price Prediction (CarDekho)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts the selling price of used cars using machine learning.  
The dataset is taken from Kaggle (CarDekho Used Cars Dataset).

## 📂 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle – CarDekho Used Cars Dataset
- Features used:
  - Year of manufacture (myear)
  - Kilometers driven (km)
  - Fuel type
  - Transmission
  - Body type
- Target variable:
  - listed_price

⚠️ Note: The dataset is not uploaded to GitHub because of GitHub’s 25MB file size limit.
